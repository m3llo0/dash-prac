# dash-prac
This has been an amazing summex for my HTML & CSS learning on The Odin Project for the past 1 month. I'm happy to say that I was able to apply the skills I have learnt, especially regarding Grid and Flexbox to build this dashboard layout, and it was just the right amount of challenge to stimulate my brain. I've also managed to learn some new concepts/best practices while reviewing and debugging my code, allowing me to quickly research the most optimal ways to implement my ideas. I hope to move further into advanced topics in the coming months to further develop my skillset, because pure CSS itself honestly gets really tedious as the project increases in size.

Cheers!
